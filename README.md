Documentation has moved!

I've written a brand new GitHub Pages docs site for **Timelines (Revamped)** at [https://seanlowe.github.io/obsidian-timelines](https://seanlowe.github.io/obsidian-timelines). Go check it out! If there are any problems, don't hesitate to create a new issue and point it out. Thanks!
