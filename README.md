# Timelines (Revamped)

Generate a chronological timeline in which all "events" are notes that include a specific tag or set of tags.

See the changelog from the last major update to view any breaking changes [here](./changelog.md#v200).

Documentation has moved!

I've written a brand new GitHub Pages docs site for **Timelines (Revamped)** at [https://seanlowe.github.io](https://seanlowe.github.io). Go check it out! If there are any problems, don't hesitate to create a new issue and point it out. Thanks!

## Release Notes

### v2.1.10

Maintenance update

**Changes**:
- updated all dependencies to latest versions
- removed dependence on package `rollup-plugin-styles` as it has not been updated in 2 years and was preventing me from updating other packages
- imported vis-timeline specific styling in the SCSS rather than in the TS

See the [changelog](./changelog.md) for more details on previous releases.
