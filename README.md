# Timelines (Revamped)

Generate a chronological timeline in which all "events" are notes that include a specific tag or set of tags.

See the changelog from the last major update to view any breaking changes [here](./changelog.md#v200).

Documentation has moved!

I've written a brand new GitHub Pages docs site for **Timelines (Revamped)** at [https://seanlowe.github.io](https://seanlowe.github.io). Go check it out! If there are any problems, don't hesitate to create a new issue and point it out. Thanks!

## Release Notes

### v2.1.11

Maintenance update

**Changes**:
- made it possible to specify the textual body of an event defined via frontmatter by way of the 'description' property
- edited style rules so that whitespace within the description property (line breaks, esp.) is respected and not discarded
- reinstated the 'description' property for HTML defined events (albeit redundant) 
- updated documentation to reflect changes

See the [changelog](./changelog.md) for more details on previous releases.
